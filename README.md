The current Idea is to create a Tool that uses Google's Gemini API to fetch the course details that I want in a JSON format which I'll be able to use for further processing using Python.

Errors to be fixed:
1. The response contains prefix and ```json and suffix of ```. We must remove it before writing to the JSON file.
